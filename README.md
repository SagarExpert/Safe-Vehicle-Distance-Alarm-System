# Safe-Vehicle-Distance-Alarm-System

1.	Introduction:

     Now a days, accidents are occurring more. many of people getting injured due to the accidents. once think, how it will be if the vehicle alerts      when it comes close to another vehicles. today this project will help you to develop small prototype so that it will alerts you using Buzzer and Arduino Uno. the distance can be taken using ultrasonic sensor.
    Hence we decided to come up with the safe vehicle distance alert system. it's essentially a setup which uses the popular Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04), the Buzzer and an Arduino Uno to measure how much distance vehicle comes close to it. Hence collision between vehicles can be controlled.
  	
3.	Problem Definition :                                                                                                                            

       This project deals with the detection and management of vehicle distance and  with the     combined IOT technology.  In Order to protect people to avoid accidents the safe vehicle     distance system is important.
  
3.	Objectives & Scope :

     The main aim is detection and monitoring the vehicle distance and to minimize the accidents cause due to not maintaining proper distance. To make driver aware about keeping safe distance while driving. It can be also used for real time applications for other object detection jobs. 

4.	Hardware Requirements :
        1. Arduino UNO
        2. Buzzer
        3. Ultrasonic Sensor
        4. Jumper wires

5.	Steps of Connection :
       1.	Gather all the components and check if buzzer and Ultrasonic sensor are working fine or not.
       2. Connect the cathode of buzzer to GND & anode to 4 pin of Arduino.   
       3. Connect the Ultrasonic Sensor pins VCC, GND, Trigpin, Echopin to 5V, GND, 5, 6 respectively to Arduino.
       4. attach Arduino to laptop 
       5. Run Arduino code on Arduino IDE.
